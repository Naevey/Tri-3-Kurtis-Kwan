</br>Q10: I chose B because I didn’t really read the answer choices clearly. I was thinking of someone getting access into the database, but I didn’t read the answer choice clearly. 
</br>Q20:I chose B because I didn’t read it carefully. I saw that it sorted, combined, then removed duplicates. However, I know now that if it sorts it before combining, it wouldn't be sorted after. 
</br>Q22:I chose D because I thought that the newspaper would be a pdf, which is lower maintenance than holding a website. However, a newspaper would now provide credibility? I would think that a website could also have a way to provide credibility
</br>Q23:I chose D  because  I thought that with the public key, you would be able to decrypt their password. However, public is in its name, so it would also be public. However, the cookies would store valuable information, such as what they would look at. 
</br>Q29: I chose A because I checked it over, and I didn’t see any problems. However, using the test case is not sufficient enough
</br>Q32: I chose A because I thought making the item limit the count, it would flow better. However, I didn’t see the entire thing, so I got it wrong. Making the count 0 earlier would be much more useful.
</br>Q44: I chose B because I thought that they could have impersonated the merchant, and sent a phishing link. However, the question was least likely to indicate a phishing act.
