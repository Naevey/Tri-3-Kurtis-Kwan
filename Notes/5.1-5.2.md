|5.1|Benefits and harmful effects of Technology, such as drones being used to either take spy on people or to record footage. Additionally, dopamine is pleasure, but sometimes people spend too much on things that give them dopamine, like social media or gaming.|I think that some effects of computing are faster computing, more ways to spend leisure time, and faster ways of doing things such as shopping. For faster computing, people are able to accomplish more things in a shorter amount of time, however, some harmful effects occur. Such as, a person with malicious intent can run a virus that spreads rapidly throughout a network quickly. One other benefit is that there are many more ways to spend leisure time, such as gaming or social media. However, the problem with dopamine and addiction surfaces, as more people start to neglect their health and social life to get more pleasure. The harmful effect to faster shopping, is that there is less privacy, as companies have to have a way to store your credit card and address. I believe that there is a problem with dopamine, but I do not believe that it is affecting me a lot. I think that over quarantine, it did affect me a little bit. |
|5.2|Digital Divide, there could be people living in neighborhoods that don't have good access to electricity or internet. |I think that taking ComputerScience will empower myself. I think that eventually, I would be able to help other classmates and even other Del Norte students understand technology. I think that in the long run, paper tape does not block digital empowerment. One example is the firewall for the school, it does not inhibit most student's ability to learn, and for students that want to learn more, they have solutions such as a VPN. |Data structures, function is an optimization of the sequence, not necessarily a structure. |
|5.3|Computing Bias, there are both beneficial, harmful effects. Users are error prone, so are programs. Siri not recognizing accents can be exclusion, a harmful effect. |I don't think that the computer was intentionally racist, just that there were errors coming up, such as the camera not used to recognizing darker skin. It should be corrected, as it was not an intentional feature and it would include more customers. ||
|5.4|Crowdsourcing, Cryptocurrency is a good example of crowdsourcing, as the data and money come from independent miners. RapidAPI is another example, we have all used RapidAPI. Github is also another example.|Del Norte does crowdsource, as AP Statistics students go around looking for data. I think that our project will include crowdsourcing, as we would include students from the 3D Animation Club. That is also our crowdsource idea. |
