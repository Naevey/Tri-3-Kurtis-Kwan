|5.3|Computing Bias, there are both beneficial, harmful effects. Users are error prone, so are programs. Siri not recognizing accents can be exclusion, a harmful effect. |I don't think that the computer was intentionally racist, just that there were errors coming up, such as the camera not used to recognizing darker skin. It should be corrected, as it was not an intentional feature and it would include more customers. ||
|5.4|Crowdsourcing, Cryptocurrency is a good example of crowdsourcing, as the data and money come from independent miners. RapidAPI is another example, we have all used RapidAPI. Github is also another example.|Del Norte does crowdsource, as AP Statistics students go around looking for data. I think that our project will include crowdsourcing, as we would include students from the 3D Animation Club. That is also our crowdsource idea. |
