|5.5|Legal and Ethical Concerns - Money on patents, different licenses have different effects. Sometimes have to pay for derivatives, copyright, open source.|We created a GNU General Public License 3.0 license. We chose it because other clubs would be able to take our website without any problems.|
|5.6|Safe Computing - Multi Factor Authentication, problems with sharing information. PII, things such as email addresses or social security numbers|I have seen email addresses, home addresses, and phone numbers on other projects. I believe that PII is a good thing sometimes, sometimes you would want other people to know of your achievements. Specifically, you could leave your contact information for others to have, in case there is a company that wants to inquire about things such as a potential sponsorship. I think that a good password is one with undercase, capital letters, numbers, and symbols. I believe that having multiple types of characters will make it harder to brute force the password. Symmetric encryption uses the same key to decrypt every encrypted thing. Assymetric encryption is using public and private key pairs to encrypt data. We use key pairs for deployment, specifically for passwords. I think that one phishing technique that I have learned was when my friend made a fake facebook website, and I put a password into that website. I think that the most common way for phishing are with emails, or messages. I have also seen a phishing attack, in the form of fake discord nitro messages.|
